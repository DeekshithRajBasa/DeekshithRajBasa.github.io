After a span of five years, the highly anticipated new portfolio is released. This revamped version incorporates several notable technologies such as Angular, Tailwind CSS, and Lottie animations. These technologies enhance the functionality, design, and visual appeal of the portfolio. 

However, in its current state, the portfolio's beta version is specifically designed to work on desktop devices. It may not provide an optimized experience on mobile or other platforms yet. The focus during the development phase has been on perfecting the desktop version before expanding its compatibility to other devices. This approach ensures that the portfolio delivers an exceptional user experience on desktop platforms while laying the foundation for future adaptations to different screen sizes and devices.
